# August Meetup

### News

[CampJS](http://campjs.com) this month was an absolute blast. Plenty of Rubyists were there despite the eye bleed inducing syntax of javascript.  The next CampJS will be held near Melbourne sometime in Feb 2014. If you can make it, you most definitely should!

The draw for the next [RailsCamp 2013](http://syd14.railscamps.org/) is now open. This time, it will be held in Sydney, 1 - 4 Nov, and tickets are $275.

### Talks

Dylan gave a _presentation on automated iOS testing with Capybarrium, that kind of turned into a talk about hacking Capybara and Selenium.

Rob gave a quick and dirty summary of the std lib Logger class.

This was followed by a round/square table/forum type discussion about deployment options. Oh the many options.

Decks to follow...

### Dinner

There was much rejoicing, thanks to free beers from [NineFold](http://ninefold.com/)
