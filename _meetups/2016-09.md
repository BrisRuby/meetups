Ruby's standard library is [#awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y). Our survey results say moar beginner talks.  So this month we will get back-to-basics [^1].

We are running a range of short talks covering the interesting and essential ruby basics and rails fundamentals.  Know how to zip an array? Or when to tap that hash? Yes or no, it doesn't really matter - just come along for dinner and drinks!

Talks may (or may not) include....

  - _Show me a little Rspec_ by [Nigel](https://twitter.com/nr99)

  - _[Tom](https://github.com/ridget) used these 5 simple tricks with Ruby. You wont believe what happened next...._

  - How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Block.

  - Eat. Sleep. Range. Repeat.

  - The Last of the Enumerables.

  - The Man with One Red Test.

  - Tales from the BCrypt.


6PM start, arrive any time after 5:30pm

Dinner afterwards at 8pm
