Ruby - DTracing Ruby

   These scripts trace activity of the Ruby programming language, and
   require the DTrace Ruby provider written by Joyent.

   Currently, the DTrace Ruby provider is a seperate download either in
   patch, source or binary form. Start with the "Ruby DTrace" link on
   http://dtrace.joyent.com/, and after getting a version running, the
   scripts in this directory should work.

   Since the DTrace Ruby provider is under development, there is a chance
   that it has changed slightly by the time you are reading this, causing
   these scripts to either break or behave oddly. Firstly, check for newer
   versions of the DTraceToolkit; if it hasn't been updated and you need
   to use these scripts immediately, then updating them shouldn't take
   too long. The following was the state of the provider when these scripts
   were written - check for changes and update the scripts accordingly,

	provider ruby {
       probe method-entry(classname, methodname, filename, lineno);
       probe method-return(classname, methodname, filename, lineno);
       probe cmethod-entry(classname, methodname, filename, lineno);
       probe cmethod-return(classname, methodname, filename, lineno);
       probe require-entry(requiredfile, filename, lineno);
       probe require-return(requiredfile, filename, lineno);
       probe find-require-entry(requiredfile, filename, lineno);
       probe find-require-return(requiredfile, filename, lineno);
       probe load-entry(loadedfile, filename, lineno);
       probe load-return(loadedfile, filename, lineno);
       probe raise(classname, filename, lineno);
       probe object-create(classname, filename, lineno);
       probe array-create(length, filename, lineno);
       probe hash-create(length, filename, lineno);
       probe string-create(length, filename, lineno);
       probe parse-begin(sourcefile, lineno);
       probe parse-end(sourcefile, lineno);

       // optional:
       probe gc-mark-begin();
       probe gc-mark-end();
       probe gc-sweep-begin();
       probe gc-sweep-end();
	};
