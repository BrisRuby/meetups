# BrisRuby June 2013 Meetup

Sick and [slack](https://github.com/davekinkead) presenters forced [Nigel](https://github.com/nigelr) to _ad lib_ with a kata on [Test Driven Development](https://github.com/BrisRuby/roman).  A comparison with rspec and minitest has been provided which interestingly show's very few differences.

[Matt](https://github.com/mattconnolly) gave an [interesting talk](zeromq.pdf) on Zero MQ and what distinguishes it from Rabbit & Resque.

Next month, Dave _may_ just remember he is presenting a lightning talk on rspec vs minitest.
