Tom is afraid of big objects, which explains his love of lego, except when he steps on a brick and summons the devil incarnate.

Outside of crafting software, when he does bask in the sunlight, it is typically only to transport himself to the nearest supply of ramen, burritos, or beer, if it's a particularly good day, all three.
