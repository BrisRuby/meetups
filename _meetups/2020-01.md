## Notes

- List of Objectives for the year (I forget them)

- Nigel mentioned a day-long intensive practice event where you pair together on small programming exercises with constraints you don't typically have at work designed to get you thinking about code differently than you would otherwise.  This was https://www.coderetreat.org/pages/about/, it's performed around the world on a particular day, unfortunately in November, but there is a great catalogue of exercises on the site.
