title: rSpec vs Minitest Smackdown
author: Dave Kinkead
meetup: January 2015
---

It's the first meetup of the year. 2014 was a cracker of a year and 2015 looks even better.  Remember - we've moved our meetups to the 4th Tuesday of every month so the 27th is it. 

Yes it's hot, yes it's school holiday, and yes you'll be hung over. But, you'll be in lovely AC, away from any kids, and get some hair-of-the-dog to make that hangover go away!
