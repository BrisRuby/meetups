# To Do

## CSS

  - blockquote style needed - perhaps a nice big " on the :before
  - earlier / later post links don't align vertically
  - need to style author bio
  - people page
  - will need a credits page linked from the footer with a big shout out to Elliot

## Code

  - Dave to add some people data. Will then need to make it look snazzy - not sure what yet
  - Dave to add a google map to the about page
  - footer will need a license - I'll talk to Nigel but I think a CC-BY-SA would be appropriate
